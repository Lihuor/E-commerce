This is an E-commerce using Next.js for building a beautiful interface. For Content creater, I use Sanity as a back-end to develop the product details including images uploading and product creation. For Payment Process Platform, I use Stripe which is one of the most suitable and convenience payment plaforms. And finally, I use Vercel for application deployment.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Product Contents

## Deploy on Vercel
